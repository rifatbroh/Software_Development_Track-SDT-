         <p>Once upon a time, a lion was walking beside the jungle.
            Suddenly, the lion saw a cute deer grazing near some bushes. 
            The lion was very hungry and thought, "This deer will be my dinner!"
         </p>
            
         <p>
            The lion walked away, still hungry, but feeling proud of his choice.
            The deer and her babies stayed safe and happy.
